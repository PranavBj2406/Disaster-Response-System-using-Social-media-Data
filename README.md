# 🌐 Disaster Response System using Social Media Data

A real-time big data pipeline to detect and respond to crisis events using social media platforms like Twitter. This project leverages Big Data technologies to extract, process, and analyze disaster-related tweets, enabling rapid response and situational awareness.

---

## 🚀 Goal

To detect disaster and crisis events in real-time from social media data streams, helping authorities and emergency services act swiftly and efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Importance

In times of crisis—such as earthquakes, floods, or wildfires—social media platforms often become the first point of reporting. By analyzing these posts in real time:

- **Early detection** of events becomes possible, even before official sources report them.
- **Geographic insights** help identify affected locations for faster resource allocation.
- **Automated alert systems** reduce dependency on manual monitoring.
- **Link analytics** offer network insights into areas, users, or topics related to the disaster.

This system bridges the gap between public information and institutional response.

## 🛠️ Key Components

- **Real-Time Scraping:** Collect tweets using Twitter’s API based on disaster-related keywords.
- **HDFS Storage:** Store raw tweet logs using Hadoop Distributed File System for scalability.
- **MapReduce Filtering:** Filter relevant tweets using MapReduce jobs.
- **Hive Queries:** Identify and query affected areas using Hive SQL.
- **MongoDB Alerts:** Store real-time alerts for dashboard or notification systems.
- **Spark Streaming:** Process and analyze data in real time.
- **Link Analytics:** Understand relations between events and locations through graph-based analysis.
